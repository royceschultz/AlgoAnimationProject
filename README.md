# Polygon Triangulation Algorithms

This project uses manim to render animations for triangulation algorithms.

The Manim animation files include:
* QuadraticTriangulation.py - A n^2 method for triangulating polygons
* MakeMonotone.py - A nlog(n) method for decomposing polygons into monotone sub-polygons.

To run:
* Install requirements - pip install -r requirements.txt
* Render - manim render [filename
] -q [quality settting:l|m|h|p|k]
